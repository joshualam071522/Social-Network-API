## Description

The main idea of the project was to create a mock social network api that uses a nosql database to create, edit, and delete a user, along with adding friends, thoughts, and reactions related to the user. The main technologies used for this project include express for the routes and mongodb for the database. Mongoosedb is specially used in this project, a long with a helper package called date-and-time to format javascript code for date.

## Installation

In order to install this application, the user would have to clone the repository. From there, they would use the command "npm install" to install all the relevant packages.

## Usage

To use the application, you must have mongodb compass installed to establish a connection. From there, you can start the server by typing in the console "npm start". From there you should see a message that says "Server running on port 3001!" To test out the api, you must have an application like Insomnia installed to test out the routes. To test out all the routes, simply check the routes folder to see what routes are available. You can also use mongodb compass to see the data you added to either the thoughts or user collection.
